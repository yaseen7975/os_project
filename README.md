# Real-Time Memory Allocation Tracker

## üìò Project Overview

**Real-Time Memory Allocation Tracker (RTMAT)** is a C-based system utility designed to monitor, track, and optimize memory usage dynamically in real time. Developed as part of the CSE316 Operating Systems course at Lovely Professional University, this project helps identify memory allocation patterns, memory leaks, fragmentation, and overall memory management efficiency in operating systems.
